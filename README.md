# Code-refactor
Bootcamp homework assignment no. 1

For this homework assignment, we addressed several different elements of an otherwise functioning website with the goal of improving, organizing, consolidating, and adding specificity to the code.
Such improvements included consolidating redundant CSS, such as combining ".benefit-lead," ".benefit-brand," ".benefit-cost" into 1 css element (margin-bottom: 32px; color: #ffffff;) or fixing a broken link, such as pairing "section id="search-engine-optimization"" with it's nav button.
Other fixes/improvements included:
adding alt text to images
sequencing heading tags in the correct order
adding meta tags, using keywords to describe the content of the webpage
adding a title
replacing < div > tags with semantic elements
adding comments to describe the specific parts of the code
